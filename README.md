Molchanov Nick Frontend take-home test.

__npm i__

__node reverse__
(this is interactive node CLI program which will prompt user to enter values and while exiting program - will print out reversed order of inputed lines. My view of reverse c) task :))

__npm run test__
(this includes tests for first task of group.ts and for second task of reverseSrc/LinkedList.ts + reverse.ts)
***

Problem set consists of two tasks:

- group.ts
- reverse.ts

For the first problem, in addition to the implementation, we expect that you provide tests as well. In package.json we already listed mocha and chai as dependencise but you're free to use any approach you want as long as it's not console.log call.

Problems are not designed to be hard or tricky. You should not waste time looking for hidden patterns.

Please don't post problems and solutions publicly (on github or similar).

If there's something we should clarify or help with, please don't hesitate to ask.
