Problem set consists of two tasks:

- group.ts
- reverse.ts

For the first problem, in addition to the implementation, we expect that you provide tests as well. In package.json we already listed mocha and chai as dependencise but you're free to use any approach you want as long as it's not console.log call.

Problems are not designed to be hard or tricky. You should not waste time looking for hidden patterns.

Please don't post problems and solutions publicly (on github or similar).

If there's something we should clarify or help with, please don't hesitate to ask.
